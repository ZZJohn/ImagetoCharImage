This is a program to transform an image into a ASCII characters image which looks like the original one.

The file original_ascii.py is from Shiyanlou (https://www.shiyanlou.com/courses/370), a Chinese website to learn computer science online. I made small modification to that code and the file myascii.py is my own version. I learned two python packages, Argparse and Pillow from writing the code.

demo1.png and demo2.jpg are the original images and demo1.txt and demo2.txt are the output text files.

To use the python code, type in command line: python myascii.py imagename -o outputfilename -w widthoftextfile, -o and -w are optional and the default values are "output.txt" and 100 respectively.
